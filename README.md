## Instruction
Our project built an interactive kitchen scene, where users can perform a series of relevant actions in the kitchen by grabbing and moving the colored object models, such as resetting chairs or cooking.

Initially the kitchen scene model could not be seen in the VR environment, but later we tried to put it into the WorldInteractionDemo scene and it was possible. Besides, it needed to set up the Box/Mess Collider component for the kitchen countertop. Otherwise, the model cannot be displayed or interacted with the base plane.
